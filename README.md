# Stock Analysis

## Project Overview
Steve is researching stock trends for his parents. I've already created a macro that will analyize the stock data he gave me, but we want to improve it so he can analize larger sets of data. 

1. Refractor the VBA code
2. Measure the performance of the code.
3. Take note of pros and cons of refractoring the code
